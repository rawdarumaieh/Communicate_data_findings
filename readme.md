## Summary of Findings

> Contraty to my expectations, the correlation coefficient between suicides/100k pop and  GDP per Capita s very low ! approaching zero which means that approximatly there are no relationship between gdp per capita and suicids per 100k population. I assumed that GDP per Capita will influence the suicidal rate as GDP per capita measures the rate of prosperity of a country based on the economical growth therefore I believed that countries having a prospert life will tend to have less suidical rates
>1. *sex*: Male seems to have a wider spread than Females and a larger median, therefore on average males are committing suicides than females from year 1850 till 2016
>2. *Generation*: GI Generation are the most generation that committed suicicde followed by Silent generation and Boomers where GI having a wider spread 
>3. *Age*: People who are 75+ committed suicide the most followed by the fourties and sixties age bracket where they are approximatly the same
>4.  *Year*: Year 2000, 1995 and 2002 are years where most people suicided with a median equal to 2000 and 20002 
>5.  *Country*: Most of who committed suicide are from Austria 
>Males were equal to Females throughout all the generations
>I also wanted to underestand the features of each generation I noticed that GI generations that had the most suicide rates included mostly people of 75+ years old.
>Year 1995 and Aruba had the highest suicidal rate when I viewed them I found that such a number is an outlier 
>Number of males in GI generations who committed suicide are more then the double of Females.
>The most recent years incuded less suicidal rates than old years.. it seems that Austria had high rates in all of the chosen years. While Mexico kept its low rates along all years.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Some countries could keep the rates consistent throughout years while other countries had different rates with inconsistent trends. Those countries who had high rates consistently are worthy of further investigations 
> GI Generation was the most generation committed suicide in all years and along all countries. Old people make the most of this generation. Studying the feature of this generation can surly make us understand the reason behind this trend
